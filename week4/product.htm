            In the tumultuous business of cutting-in and attending to a whale, there is much running backwards and forwards among the
            crew. Now hands are wanted here, and then again hands are wanted there. There is no staying in any one place;
            for at one and the same time everything has to be done everywhere. It is much the same with him who endeavors
            the description of the scene. We must now retrace our way a little. It was mentioned that upon first breaking
            ground in the whale's back, the blubber-hook was inserted into the original hole there cut by the spades of the
            mates. But how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook get fixed in that hole? It was inserted there
            by my particular friend Queequeg, whose duty it was, as harpooneer.
